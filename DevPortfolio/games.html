            <p>This was my first game I ever made, created in Construct 3. Broken Tavern is a short Magic Card Playing game similar to Magic the Gathering, where you and the enemy have a healthbar and mana bar. Each card requires a certain amount of mana, and do different things. I made this game by myself within 2 weeks and had struggled with time crunching and removing/changing initial aspects of this game.
            <br><br>
            I've spent over a year updating Broken Tavern, whether that's bugpatching, hotfixes, adding on to the original content. I had major plans for this game ever since the start, and I eventually want to add this game to Steam.
            <br><br>
            In my initial prototype, this game was very small. There were many issues, including glitched values or the mana bar not working. At the time, I declared these bugs I couldn't fix as 'intentional', even though it majorly changed the gameplay.</p>

            <p>Another game made in Construct 3, this was my first game with a team. Colorful Cooking is a working-simulator game, similar to one of the Papa Louie franchise. I created background and tilemap assets, and programmed the game. Working within a week, this was in a game jam with the theme of Colorful. I also struggled with time crunching in this project, and had to remove many orignal thoughts and aspects.</p>
